At the moment, this is no more than a simple page with links to my profiles in various corners of the web. One day, in the mysterious future, I'll build some kind of portfolio.

I've given it all an MIT license. If this somehow restricts you or gets in the way, tell me. I'm hardly attached or dead-set.
